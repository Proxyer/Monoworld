  <ANDH.NuzzleDetectedDesc>{NOTICED_nameDef} noticed that {PAWN_nameDef}'s behavior toward {INFECTED_nameDef} was unusually aloof, unlike {PAWN_possessive} typical warmth. Rather, {PAWN_nameDef} seemed to stare intently at {INFECTED_nameDef}, as if sensing something strange. In hindsight, {PAWN_nameDef} could recall moments when {INFECTED_nameDef}'s behavior seemed slightly peculiar. {NOTICED_nameDef} suspects that {INFECTED_nameDef} might be infected with a metalhorror.</ANDH.NuzzleDetectedDesc>
